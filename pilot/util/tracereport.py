"""Rucio tracing report.

This module provides :class:`TraceReport`, a dict subclass that accumulates
metadata about a single file transfer and submits it to the Rucio tracing
server at the end of the operation.

Each instance is pre-populated with default field values matching the Rucio
tracing schema (see the Tracing report document in the Pilot GitHub wiki).
Callers update fields via the standard :meth:`dict.update` / item-assignment
interface and then call :meth:`TraceReport.send` when the transfer is
complete.

Two special keys — ``ipv`` and ``workdir`` — are accepted at construction
time but are stored as instance attributes rather than dict entries so they
are never serialised into the payload sent to the server.

Several traces can be sent in one request with :func:`send_bulk` (the Rucio
trace server accepts a list of traces since Rucio 37). See also
:mod:`pilot.util.tracesender` for sending traces in the background.

Where a trace goes (:meth:`TraceReport.send` and :func:`send_traces`):

1. to the spool file, in a middleware container script (see
   :func:`enable_trace_spool`); the pilot sends these traces after the
   container has finished;
2. to the background sender of the job, if there is one (it registers
   itself with :func:`set_background_sender`);
3. otherwise, the traces are sent at once, as before.
