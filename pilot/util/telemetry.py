"""Structured pilot telemetry (pilot attributes) sent to the PanDA server once per job.

The document is sent after the final job update has been accepted by the server. It contains the raw pilot
timestamps, durations derived from them and a few file counters. It is independent of the job metadata (job
report) and of the ``pilotTiming`` field of the job update, which is left unchanged.

Request body (schema version 1)::

    {"job_id": <int>, "pilot_version": "<str>",
     "pilot_attributes": {"schema_version": 1,
                          "timestamps": {<name>: <int epoch seconds>, ..},
                          "durations": {<name>: <int seconds>, ..},
                          "counters": {<name>: <int or dict>, ..},
                          "truncated": [<dropped section>, ..]}}   # only if the size limit was hit

Missing values are omitted rather than reported as 0, and durations keep their sign. A section that could not be
assembled is omitted, while a section with nothing to report is present but empty. The size limit applies to the
uncompressed JSON of the pilot_attributes dictionary only.

Until the server endpoint is available, the request body is only logged (see send_pilot_telemetry()).

Nothing in this module raises, and telemetry never affects the job.
