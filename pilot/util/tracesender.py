"""Background sender for Rucio traces.

Traces handed to a :class:`TraceSender` are sent by a daemon thread, in
requests of at most ``[Rucio] trace_batch_size`` traces, so that sending them
never delays the payload. There is one sender per job, kept in a registry
keyed by the job id (see :func:`get_or_create_sender`).

Number of requests sent at the same time:

- ``PARALLEL_TRACES=<n>`` in the queue's catchall field asks for ``n``
  requests, capped at ``[Rucio] trace_max_parallel``. Without the key, or with
  an invalid value, one request at a time is sent.
- After the first failed request, or a request slower than
  ``[Rucio] trace_slow_threshold`` seconds, the sender is *degraded* and sends
  one request at a time for the rest of the job.

The traces must be sent before the final server update, since the job
metrics are built there. :func:`finish_traces` is therefore called just
before the final update, and the remaining traces are sent first, bounded by:

- ``[Rucio] trace_final_wait`` seconds if sending is healthy;
- ``[Rucio] trace_timeout`` seconds if it is degraded (also when it degrades
  during the wait), so that the traces queued at the end of the job, e.g. by
  stage-out, still get one chance;
- graceful stop (no wait if it is already set).

The traces that have not been sent then are abandoned. Abandoned traces, and
traces in failed requests, are counted as lost. ``finish()`` then logs the
job's trace report, which lists every trace and what happened to it (see
:mod:`pilot.util.tracesummary`).

Copytools send their traces with :meth:`TraceReport.send`, which hands them
to the job's sender when there is one (this module registers itself with
:func:`~pilot.util.tracereport.set_background_sender`). The stage-in and
stage-out entry points create the sender with :func:`get_or_create_sender`.
Traces that a middleware container script wrote to the spool file are sent
with :func:`collect_spooled_traces` after the container has finished.
