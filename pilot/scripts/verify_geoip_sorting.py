"""Check whether the client IP sent to rucio.list_replicas() changes the geoip replica order.

The pilot sends a client_location with its local IP address. The Rucio server replaces that
IP with the request's source address before geoip sorting, so the order is expected to be
the same whatever IP is sent. This script lists the replica order for the same files with
several client IPs and reports whether the orders differ.

Usage (after setupATLAS; lsetup rucio; voms-proxy-init -voms atlas):

    python3 verify_geoip_sorting.py <scope:name> [<scope:name> ...]

Use files with replicas at sites on several continents, otherwise the comparison shows little.
Exit code: 0 if the order is identical for all IPs, 1 if it differs, 2 on usage or setup errors.
